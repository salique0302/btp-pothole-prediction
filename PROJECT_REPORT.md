# Pothole Detection System Using Convolutional Neural Networks
## Detailed Project Report

### 1. Project Overview
The Pothole Detection System is a real-time image classification solution that uses deep learning to identify potholes in road images and video feeds. The system employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze road surfaces and classify them into two categories: roads with potholes and plain roads without potholes.

### 2. Technical Architecture

#### 2.1 Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of the following layers:
```
1. Input Layer: Accepts grayscale images of size 100x100 pixels
2. Convolutional Layer 1: 
   - 16 filters of size 8x8
   - Stride: 4x4
   - Padding: Valid
   - Activation: ReLU
3. Convolutional Layer 2:
   - 32 filters of size 5x5
   - Padding: Same
   - Activation: ReLU
4. Global Average Pooling Layer
5. Dense Layer 1:
   - 512 neurons
   - Dropout: 0.1
   - Activation: ReLU
6. Output Layer:
   - 2 neurons (binary classification)
   - Activation: Softmax
```
